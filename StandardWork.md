# Standard Work, a devOps Point of View

For the information below, ... It would be easy to get into a discussion is a given point, or technique a Lean, Agile, or DevOps thing.
There is overlap in Lean, Agile, and DevOps and this type of discussion is a waste of time.  Given that, we will not make a distinction.

Intents:
- Tracability
  All Changes to a solution must be tracable to the reason for the change.  In the case of code, or configuration, all changes must have
  a corresponding Story Card that explains the intent of the change and the acceptance criteria.  The Card Identifier, must be part of the
  commit message to source control.
  
  All changes to code and configuration must be source controlled.  "Source Control All Things"
  
  Misc:
  - Story cards should be small enough to complete in 3 days or less
  
  
  
## Daily

- Pull a Story Card
  - 3 Amigo to make sure Story and Acceptance Criteria are understood.
  - Assign Card to you
- Create a Source Control Branch
  - May be for a group of related cards
  - 3 Days or less of work
- Use Test Driven Development (TDD) Process during implementation.
- Unit Test and Component Test Coverage >= 70%
  The Intent of Unit Tests and Component Tests are for the benefit of the engineer during the development process.
- Automate Acceptance Criteria (ATDD)
  NOTE: This is not the same as unit tests.
  ATDD is to prove that the Story Card Criteria have been met.
